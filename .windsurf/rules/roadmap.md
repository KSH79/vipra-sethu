At the end of each conversation check ROADMAP.md in docs folder if we need to update the tasks to be completed i.e. check or uncheck the tasks based on state of the codebase. If we have completed a task, after marking that complete suggest the next task that can be taken up from the Top  10 Backlog in the same document and provide reasons for why you are recommendating that as the next task to be taken up. After that scan through all the other backlog items and update the Top 10 Backlog items if the task that we have completed last is from this list (to ensure that at all times there are 10 items in the backlog).
