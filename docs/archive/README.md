# Archived Documentation

## Overview

**These files were consolidated into the main documentation structure on 08-Nov-2025**

## What's Here

These 30+ markdown files have been archived as part of documentation consolidation. Their content has been merged into the 6 core documentation files in the parent directory.

### Consolidated Files

**From → To:**

- `00-vision.md` + `01-product-brief.md` + `02-personas.md` → `PRODUCT.md`
- `10-architecture.md` + `11-data-model-and-schemas.md` → `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `development-roadmap.md` + `to-do.md` → `ROADMAP.md`
- `analytics-setup.md` + `environment-setup.md` → `OPERATIONS.md`
- `15-dev-workflow.md` + parts of other docs → `DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`
- `08-ux-wireframes.md` + `09-ui-ux-enhancements.md` → Referenced in ARCHITECTURE.md
- All other files → Merged into appropriate core docs

### Current Documentation Structure

**Core Files (in parent directory):**

1. `README.md` - Entry point & quick start
2. `DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` - Local setup & Git workflow
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design + ADRs
4. `PRODUCT.md` - Product vision & requirements
5. `ROADMAP.md` - Development plan & GitHub workflow
6. `OPERATIONS.md` - Monitoring & runbooks

**Specialized Folders:**

- `21-adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `22-rfc/` - Request for Comments (future features)

### Why This Was Done

1. **Reduce maintenance burden** - From 35+ files to 6 core files
2. **Easier navigation** - Clear hierarchy with single entry point
3. **Better discoverability** - Related content grouped together
4. **Consistent style** - Unified formatting and tone
5. **Living documents** - Each core doc has clear update instructions
