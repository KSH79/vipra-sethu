## The Problem

### What's Broken Today

**Finding ritual-fit service providers is hard.**

When a Madhwa Brahmin family in Bangalore needs a purohit for their son's Upanayana ceremony, they face these challenges:

- **No central directory** - Must rely on word-of-mouth, WhatsApp groups, or random Google searches
- **Language barriers** - Need someone who speaks Kannada and understands local customs
- **Time-consuming** - Calling multiple people, asking for references, checking availability
- **No transparency** - Don't know pricing, experience, or what services they actually provide

**The same problem exists for:**

- Finding a cook who understands dietary restrictions and festival preparations
- Locating senior care providers familiar with traditional practices
- Connecting with tutors who can teach Sanskrit or Vedic studies

### Why This Matters

Our community values tradition, trust, and shared understanding. When you need someone to perform sacred rituals or care for your family, you want someone who "gets it" - someone who shares your values and understands your needs without lengthy explanations.

Right now, finding these people is like searching for a needle in a haystack.

## What We're NOT Building

### Out of Scope

**Payment Processing:**

- We don't handle money
- Providers and seekers negotiate directly
- No commission or platform fees
- Reason: Keeps it simple, builds trust, avoids regulations

**Booking Management:**

- No calendar or scheduling system (for now)
- No automated booking confirmations
- Providers manage their own schedules
- Reason: MVP focus, can add later if needed

**Background Checks:**

- No formal verification service
- Admins do basic review, not deep background checks
- Community trust is primary mechanism
- Reason: Cost and complexity, relies on community vetting

**Nationwide Launch:**

- Starting with Bangalore only
- Madhwa Brahmins first
- Will expand gradually
- Reason: Better to serve one community well than many poorly

**Social Network Features:**

- No messaging system within platform
- No user profiles or social features
- No forums or discussion boards
- Reason: Keep it focused on directory, not social media

### Constraints

**Geographic:**

- Bangalore only for first 6 months
- Expand to other cities based on demand
- India-focused (no international)

**Community:**

- Starting with Madhwa Brahmins
- Will add other Brahmin communities
- May expand to other communities later

**Technology:**

- Web-only for now (no mobile app initially)
- Works on mobile browsers
- Simple, fast, accessible

**Moderation:**

- Manual admin approval (no automated verification)
- Small team of trusted community members
- Personal review of each provider
